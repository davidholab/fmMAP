# fmMAP: A Framework Reducing Site-Bias Batch Effect from Foundation Models in Pathology

<img src="./fig/bcss_accuracy_v3.png" alt="fmMAP Performance">
We propose Foundation Model-based Manifold Approximation Pipeline (fmMAP) to reduce the batch effect by adjusting features from FMs. Our framework employs supervised uniform manifold approximation (UMAP) to transform features generated by FMs into an optimal space. In this transformed space, characteristics of features of interest (i.e., biological features) are highlighted while other confounding factors are reduced.
